# Zig OpenGL experiments

Some small experiments in Zig and OpengGL that you may find interesting. In my opinion, Zig is a great langage for game programming. It's pretty fast but also very flexible.

# Demos

## Ulum spirals

Inspired by the Coding Train (**[episode 167](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a35KWEjRvc0)**).

## Particles

A simple particle simulation using instance rendering and spatial hashing. 

# Running

You will need libepoxy and glfw on your system.

```sh
zig build particles
```
